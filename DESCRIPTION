Chapter: Sampling
Description: This app visualizes how the confidence level and sample size affect
    the outcome confidence interval for a single proportion. The app also explores
    non-response bias when respondents are chosen from a population with a
    different true proportion causing non-response bias.
LearningObjectives: c(
    "The student will learn to understand Concept A in way z.",
    "The student will learn to understand Concept B as description y."
